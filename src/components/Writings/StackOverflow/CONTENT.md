Stack Overflow, the website which I have poked jokes at many times in my career. I've used it as a resource all through my different levels of development, my opinion changing throughout. Towards the later years as I became more independently skilled, I'd visit a post expecting to see an answer of poor quality with questionable code, but possibly with a hint to what it is I was searching for, and an answer with something even more questionable. However, still there are extremely high quality answers, written by a knowledge expert who has respectably taking the time out of their day to answer this stranger, and to answer it in such of a way to share their knowledge so clearly that the person answering and the community also become knowledge experts.

I am now mostly an independently engineer, I can build a lot of different things in all areas of the web stack without much trouble (that doesn't mean I often get bits wrong and my loverly co-workers gratefully pick me up on them). I'm now branching into Rust, which leads me to the point of this post.

While looking for the answer to something in the late of night, the harsh #ffffff background colo[u]r was blinding me. I wanted that night mode and I had a vague memory of seeing it and thinking perhaps Stack Overflows UX is a little off and the control has only been added to the logged in user menu. I log in and I'm taken to my profile page, a page that I have not seen for many years - I don't ask or answer questions any more, why do I need to log into Stack Overflow?

I see my very first post from 10 years ago.
706 views - not a lot.
2 up votes - not bad, I guess.
5 up votes - well at least it helped someone other than me.
The content has jQuery in it (I smirked).

The code - it seems I didn't have a spacebar on my keyboard, but otherwise it's ok. The answer tl;dr, I needed to run the code when the page loaded, not just after a user action.

For most of my career I've had a lot of very talented people to learn from, they became my Stack Overflow. Verbally and tweaking my contributed changes on Github to help me be constantly improving my approaches. I'm now surrounded by other engineers at Spotify. Thousands. Engineers of all different abilities. From associates straight out of University to holy crap. I have no shortage of knowledge experts to learn from.

I look back at that first question, and the ones after it, there's 15 in total over a period of 3 months. This was when I first came into the world of Software Engineering. I was working by myself in a School. In charge of the schools website, where I had built a homework system and academic reporting platform that all the staff, students and parents could log into. It showed the student's timetables, homework, grades... plus an interactive SVG map that showed where all the staff lived and searchable attributes on every room in the building. This was the first thing I built, which is hindsight is fucking nuts, there's 100s of companies around where this is there business model. Harry now is screaming at the past saying "SaaS IT YOU IDIOT!". Anyway, it was built in PHP and jQuery - React wasn't around back then, Angular was though and that would be my first introduction to frameworks.

The key part to the above paragraph is "I was working by myself". The Stack Overflow community, made up of all of us, helped me to scale that learning curve when I didn't have an insanely smart engineer over the desk from me, or to ping on Slack "Hey man, can I grab you for a couple minutes on Tuple/Huddle/Meet?".

I should log on and pay it forward.

I decided to reach out to the guy who answered my first question on Stack Overflow.

Hi Steven,

I just wanted to thank you for exactly 10 years ago today taking the time to answer my very first question on Stack Overflow.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13473405/jquery-cookie-function

I was extremely new to coding, working by myself in a school, and people like yourself who took the time to help a random person on the internet. You helped me in a small way to get to where I am today.

Thank you

Harry Hogg
